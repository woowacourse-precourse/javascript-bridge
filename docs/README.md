# ðŸ‘‰ Feature Implementation list

## Domain Logic
- [x] Implement class that returns random number
- [x] Implement class that makes bridge depending on received random number
- [x] Implement class that controls the game depending on user input
 - [x] Function that moves user
 - [x] Function that restarts the game
- [ ] Write test case for each function

## UI Logic
- [x] Implement class that receives input from user
  - [x] Function that receives size of bridge
    - [x] Throw error when input is NaN
    - [x] Throw error when input is less than 1
  - [x] Function that receives which cell to move to
    - [x] Throw error when input isn't 'U' or 'D'
  - [x] Function that receives whether game should restart or not
    - [x] Throw error when input isn't 'Q' or 'R'

- [x] Implement class that print output to user
  - [x] Function that prints current position of user
  - [x] Function that prints total result of the game

## Refactor
- [ ] Divide into classes
- [ ] make sure every function has less than 10 lines
- [ ] make sure every function has no more than 3 parameters
- [ ] extract conditional statements, output strings and constant values into constant file
